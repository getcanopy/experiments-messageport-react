# PortPortal (or whatever we call it)

PortPortal simply takes any message sent to its port, and sets the react props on everything inside the data of the message. It's a simple way to pass data from one component to another.

It also makes the context available via a hook

You can see it in action by running the tests, Or via `yarn start`
